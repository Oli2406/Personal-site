# 🌐 Oliver Kastner — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website which will be built to showcase my projects, skills and background.

The app is a **full-stack project**:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- Backend: Java Spring Boot + PostgreSQL

🧭 The goal is to create an interactive and modern portfolio where I can:
- Present my experience and projects dynamically
- Display technical skills with progress tracking
- Connect with different APIs
- Manage data with my own backend

This project is currently under active development
